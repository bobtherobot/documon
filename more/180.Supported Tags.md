# Supported Tags


The following flags are processed:

@property, @method, @event
: The three basic kinds of entities normally found in a class or module. Example: `@property {type} name - description`

@package, @namespace
: Generally only one per page, but can have to. See the "Package / Namespace" section below. To Documon @package and @namespace are the same thing. They can be used interchangablly, since Documon treats them identically. 
Example: `@package foo.bar`

@class, @module
: Both entities are treated equally, but appear in the final rendered docs as "class". 
Example: `@class name`

@private, @protected, @static, @public, @readonly
: Items with these flags can be shown/hidden/filtered. 
Example `@private`

@overrides, @impliments, @extends, @inherits
: These items page HTML will incorporate inherited parent properties, methods and events, which can be toggled.

@requires
: Incorporates a list of dependancies that a module or class needs to run. Generally shows up in the "meta" section. 
Example `@requires package.Class`

@constructor
: Generally used in conjunction with a class/module, and places a colored tag near the definition.

@example
: Multiple examples can exist per item. A nice to have for templating, so the examples can be moved around and they don't have to be hard-coded into the main description. See the "Examples" section below.

@param
: Classes, modules and methods can have multiple params. See "Params" section below.

@return, @returns
: Can incorporate a {type}. 
Example `@return {object}`

@type
: See "Type" section below

@order
: By default, everything is sorted alphabetically. Use this flag if you need things to appear in a specific order. 
Example: `@order 10.4`

@header
: Used to push a general informational entry to the top of a list. See the "Header" section below.

@defaultVal, @default (not fully tested, since the inline approach is better)
: Used for a method's paramter that has a default value.

@see
: Use this to link to similar or related things. See "See Also" below.

# Comments in comments

To include /* style comments in your comments, HTML-entity-ize the slash:

For example to render this:

    &#47;**
    Something for B
    @method something
    *&#47;

... you would write:

&amp;#47;**
Something for B
@method something
*&amp;#47;

... because we are HTML encoding the "/" as "&amp;#47;"

NOTE: It was super tricky to write this explaination, that's why the above is not in a code-block.

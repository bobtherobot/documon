# Inheritance

The following tags are used to organize the relationship tree:

- @extends
- @impliments
- @inherits
- @overrides

The @extends tag is the primary tag used to establish inheritence. Documon constructs a relationship tree whenever an @extends tag is discovered and automatically processes parent/child relationships.

When defining @extends, you can use a short-hand for classes in the same package.

For example, lets say we have 2 classes as:

		/some/long/winded/package/Foo.js
		some/long/winded/package/Bar.js

... and "Bar" extends "Foo"... Rather than writing:

		@class Bar
		@package long.winded.package
		@extends long.winded.package.Foo

... we can write:

		@class Bar
		@package long.winded.package
		@extends Foo

... because Foo and Bar are in the same package. We only need to use the long-form when referencing things outside of the same package.

### About the @inherits tag

Using the @inherits tag is a little redundant, since Documon automatically figures this out based on the @extends tag. But you're free to incorporate the @inherits tag and Documon **should** honor it (e.g. construct the proper parent/chold menu relationship).

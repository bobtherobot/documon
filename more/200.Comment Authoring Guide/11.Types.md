# Types

There are no strict types, so feel free to put anything you want inbetween the brackets. (No type type-checks :)

	@prop {DOM Element} foo - description	// yields type as a string: "Dom Element"

Delimit with a pipe to offer multiple types

	@prop {string | object} foo - description	// yields an array as ["string", "object"]

Types can be placed either before or after the name. (Note that this is subject to change, since name before type is not "industry standard" [even though I think it should be] ).

	@prop {object} foo - description		// yeilds type as a string: "object"
	@prop foo {object} description			// yeilds type as a string: "object"
